225,ARTH 305 Topics on Modern Design in East Asia,"Traditional Chinese and Japanese art and design served as an important source of inspiration for European modernism. But what happened to art and design within China and Japan during the modern period? Despite China’s traditional stronghold in modular design and Japan’s current prestige in design culture, the two countries faced incredible challenges during the late 19th and early 20th century as they struggled with their own cultures’ pasts and the modern concept of art and design. This class offers a multidisciplinary approach to the study of modern East Asian art and examines how the concept of design emerged and developed in Japan and China in relation to both fine arts and industry in a broad cross-cultural nexus. While design connected modern China and Japan in ways unprecedented, the two cultures also adopted different design strategies defined by their respective cultural and historical conditions.

Much of the course focuses on painting, though discussions of architecture, design, sculpture and photography also play an important role. We begin with the question of what modernism is: When did it begin? What makes a work of art ""modern""? How is modernism different from what preceded it? Students learn to recognize, understand and discuss the defining features of modernism in its major manifestations, while also developing an understanding of themes such as the role of African art in modernism, the changing dynamics between the fine arts and popular culture, the role of technology as an influence on art, and the place of particular critics, galleries, and museums in shaping the discourses of modernism.  Individual research projects give students the chance to explore a specific artist, style or theme in depth, while a field trip to National Gallery of Art and the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington D.C. provide an opportunity to see significant works of modern art firsthand.

228,ARTH 375 Beauty,"Perhaps no term is as variously interpreted or as hard to define as ""beauty."" At one time, beauty was treated as among the ultimate values, along with goodness, truth, and justice. But in the last century or so it has been devalued, equated with prettiness or meaningless ornamentation. It has been quite out of fashion in art since the late nineteenth century. But one cannot understand much of the art of the Western tradition without understanding it as the attempt to make beautiful things, and without understanding what that goal meant in the cultures in which it had currency. And of course even now most people would not want to be without dimensions of beauty in their lives. We will look both at classic and contemporary attempts to answer such questions, and try to heighten our own appreciation for the beauty in the arts and in the world.

How did the sect start, how did it differ from mainstream Judaism, and what was its vision of the future?

Who has owned and exerted control over knowledge of nature and ways to manipulate or control it, as types of intellectual property? How have American science, technology, and medicine reflected and participated in wider social, economic, and political developments? What have been the cultural roles of the scientist, inventor, engineer, and health professional? How has the authority of modern science, technology, and medicine become established?

We survey the history of the diverse immigrant communities that trace their heritage to a vast region of the world, the variously defined ""Middle East."" In the 1990s, Islamophobia emerged as a controversial concept after decades of discussion around Orientalism and anti-Arab racism. Today, some see Islamophobia as a catch-all concept for discrediting necessary anti-terrorism measures like profiling, surveillance, and wiretaps. Others see Islamophobia as fitting into a pattern of racialized scapegoating, where people experience violence and discrimination. Topics for discussion include ethnic group and identity formation, the ""war on terror,"" connections between domestic and international US policy, and civil rights advocacy.This course is cross-listed as SOCI 234.

654,MEST 241 Romantic Orientalism & Its Critics,"Ever since Byron returned from Ottoman Greece and Ali Pasha's Albania in 1811, British culture has sought to interpret the ""mysterious"" East in ways that were as complex as they were contradictory. Romantic orientalism emerged out of the effort to describe Arabic (and especially Islamic) culture in ways that reflected not only reality but also the biases of the Europeans who did the describing: religious, political, social, and aesthetic. Our course will begin with examples of Romantic Orientalism--The History of Nourjahad, Vathek, and Byron's own The Giaour--and will then read contemporary critiques of these works (Samuel Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith, Maria Edgeworth) as well as more recent critics: Felicity Nussbaum, Adam Potkay, and Marilyn Butler. We will then read Eastern works that have had a more direct influence on our own times: The Arabian Nights, the poems of Rumi, and works of contemporary fiction and poetry by Elias Khoury, Naguib Mahfouz, Adonis, and others. Finally, we will consider film and media images of the Arab and Islamic world that have contributed to a more contemporary American version of orientalism, and we will examine the Arab world's view of these same images and stereotypes: evil sultans, alluring harems, violent terrorists. We will also consider the possibility of an occidentalism that parallels the excesses and confusions of orientalism. Our goal in all of our work will be to see the world once called ""The Orient"" reflected, refracted, and reimagined by Western and Eastern viewers. Along the way we will seek to understand how literary texts can help us to understand the complexities of different cultures. Two essays and a final exam.This course is cross-listed as ENGL 370.

At once a future-oriented revolutionary ideology and revivalist movement based on the idea of returning to an ancient homeland, the significance of Zionism in 20th and 21st centuries cannot be understated. Zionism (or rather, Zionists), produced a state Israel whose foundation has roiled politics in the Middle East until today.

And you, too, can learn to develop a sophisticated, articulate musical voice of your life and times.  Think: Symphony for the 21st century.  In this one-semester, half-credit course, students learn about the living art and discipline of music composition through lectures on its history and current practice, listening assignments, and incremental composition exercises resulting in completed, small-scale works.

Philosophy of art courses often focus exclusively on Western philosophy. This course seeks to broaden the conversation. It concerns reflections on the arts in Japanese, Indian, Native American, and African (including diasporic) cultures. It is a question, with regard to several of these cultures, whether they conceive of a distinct sphere of art at all; the arts (as is true of the West until perhaps 1750) are often not distinguished from the crafts, religious ceremony and objects, festival, medicine, and so on. This provides an interesting challenge to the Western concept of art. Prerequisite: one prior course in art history or philosophy or permission of the instructor.

This course investigates the intersections of philosophy and literature across different schools of thought, paying special attention to the work of Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, Leibniz, Plato, Tolstoy, Voltaire, and others. We will pair the treatment of philosophical issues in fiction with their treatment in more traditional philosophical genres, thereby raising and discussing the contentious question of whether philosophy can achieve things that literature cannot, and vice versa.

At one time, beauty was treated as among the ultimate values, along with goodness, truth, and justice. But in the last century or so it has been devalued, equated with prettiness or meaningless ornamentation. It has been quite out of fashion in art since the late nineteenth century. But one cannot understand much of the art of the Western tradition without understanding it as the attempt to make beautiful things, and without understanding what the goal meant in the cultures in which it had currency. And of course even now most people would not want to be without dimensions of beauty in their lives. We will look both at classic and contemporary attempts to answer such questions, and try to heighten our own appreciation for the beauty in the arts and in the world.
